# UnityDine_ExpressBackend

### -Negm, 22 Nov

hallo Dev Team! :D

This Will Be The API In-Between the Database And The App (FrontSide) itself!<br>
We Will Interacte With It From Unity Using URLS (API) To Get And Send Data From And To The DB!

This will be way better for both unity complications With MongoDB and For Testing Purposes! <br>
(We Will Use A "JS" Unit Tester - Easier To Find Help About)

We Should Be Looking For Deploying This Express Backend On Some "Service-Provider" Like Heroku, AWS, etc..<br>
But In The Near Future -Not The Main Task At Hand-!

These Are The Required Tasks At This Moment!
- MongoDB Collections Creation And attributes Setup<br>
(restaurant, UserData, Menu, Seating, reservations, Order)<br>
_Attributes Refrences Can Be Found In The Class Diagram + Add Extra Logical Things_

- API Calls (GET, POST, UPDATE, DELETE For Each Collection)<br>
_Discussion Needed To Check Exactly What Do We Need_

Check notion For Info On the FrontEnd Tasks Currently Too:<br>

*Thank You* <3
- Please Make Sure Any Additions Are Clear And Commented!
- Please run The Backend using The Following Command "npm run dev" To Get All the Benfits From "Nodemon"
